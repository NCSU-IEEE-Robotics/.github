# Wolfpack Autonomous Robotics
Welcome to the Github organization for the IEEE Student Chapter Robotics Team at NC State University. 
Each year, we build an autonomous robot to compete in the [IEEE SoutheastCon Hardware Competition](https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/student-competitions/). The Robotics theme for 2024-2025 is Mining Mayhem.

**[What is Mining Mayhem?](https://youtu.be/E4D38Sqh8mc?si=1XJk3j9jjeHyAKys)**
> The year is 2047. After GRID successfully deflected asteroids from comet 2047-5-L1, it was discovered that they contained valuable materials, Geodinium and Nebulite. Your team’s rover is recruited to quickly collect these Astral Materials before the asteroids sail off into space, never to be seen again. Your robot touches down with T-3 minutes till the point of no return, so you have to collect as many astral materials as possible, put them into cosmic shipping containers, and bring them to the rendezvous pad communicated from the telemetry. There are also reports of a strange geographical feature like a cave… With the amazing materials your robot collects, the world will be able to build new technologies never seen before!


## Join Us
You can join our club and view our organization roster via the [NCSU GetInvolved portal](https://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/ieee). 
After you've joined on GetInvolved, be sure to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/w67fRx7bdP); it's our main hub of communication!

Before you can start contributing to Github projects, you'll need to attend at least one Robotics club meeting and speak to an officer or team leader so we can add your Github account to the organization.
*Note: You'll need a public Github account to contribute here (you can use a personal account if you have one, or make one with your student email). We do **not** use the internal NC State Github Enterprise service (the one you may have used in E 115) because it doesn't allow us to publish public repositores.*
