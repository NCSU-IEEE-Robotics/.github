# Wolfpack Autonomous Robotics
Welcome to the Github organization for our robotics team! We operate within the IEEE Student Chapter at NC State University. 

Each year, we build an autonomous robot to compete in the [IEEE SoutheastCon Hardware Competition](https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/student-competitions/). The Robotics theme for 2024-2025 is Mining Mayhem.

> **[What is Mining Mayhem?](https://youtu.be/E4D38Sqh8mc?si=1XJk3j9jjeHyAKys)**
> 
> The year is 2047. After GRID successfully deflected asteroids from comet 2047-5-L1, it was discovered that they contained valuable materials, Geodinium and Nebulite. Your team’s rover is recruited to quickly collect these Astral Materials before the asteroids sail off into space, never to be seen again. Your robot touches down with T-3 minutes till the point of no return, so you have to collect as many astral materials as possible, put them into cosmic shipping containers, and bring them to the rendezvous pad communicated from the telemetry. There are also reports of a strange geographical feature like a cave… With the amazing materials your robot collects, the world will be able to build new technologies never seen before!

### We have three subteams
* **Electrical** - This group develops circuit boards, sensors, transducers, and low level firmware for the robot. We use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), and other specialized tools to develop low level C/C++ code for various microcontroller platforms. We use [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) for our schematic and PCB layout needs. If you love embedded systems, this one's for you
* **Hardware** - Charged with designing and building all the structural components of our bot, everything from CAD simulations 3D printed parts and metalwork. The hardware subteam also updates our robot's test course each year to match SoutheastCon standards. We do our CAD work in [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/)
* **Software** - The brains of the bot; this subteam controls all things autonomouse, maintaining the [ROS(Robot Operating System)](https://www.ros.org/) core that processes sensor data and drives the robot. If you love strategizing, optimizing, and developing complex subroutines for robot systems, you'll fit right in here!


# Join Us
You can join our club and view our organization roster via the **[NCSU Get Involved portal](https://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/ieee)** 

Be sure to join our **[Discord server!](https://discord.gg/w67fRx7bdP)** It's our main hub of communication

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can start contributing to Github projects, you need to attend at least one club meeting and speak to a team leader so we can add your Github account to the organization.
> 
> *You'll need a public Github account to contribute here (you can use a personal account if you have one, or make one with your student email). We do **not** use the internal NC State Github Enterprise service (the one you may have used in E 115) because it doesn't allow us to publish public repositores.* 


# For Members
Before you get started, [please take a look at our Wiki](https://github.com/NCSU-IEEE-Robotics/Wiki/wiki) for guidelines on using and contributing to our Github.

> [!TIP]
> We have a lot of stuff going on! **Digital hygene and standardization** are vital to that stuff running smoothly, so please make sure your work follows our general formatting, versioning, and documentation standards.
>
> If you haven't yet, read the [Standards Guide](https://github.com/NCSU-IEEE-Robotics/Wiki/wiki/Standards-Guide) to learn how our repositories, projects, and teams are structured.
